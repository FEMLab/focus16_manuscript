A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of unculti-vated organisms.

We de-scribe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E + V -SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of un-cultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have provided the foundation for modern studies into the composition of microbial communities. The use of these NGS methods allows for the detection and identification of (`difficult-to-culture') microorganisms using a culture-independent strategy. In the field of routine clinical diagnostics however, the application of NGS is currently limited to microbial strain typing for epidemiological purposes only, even though the implementation of NGS for microbial community analysis may yield clinically important information. This lack of NGS implementation is due to many different factors, including issues relating to NGS method standardization and result reproducibility. In this review article, the authors provide a general introduction to the most widely used NGS methods currently available (i.e., targeted amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics) and the strengths and weaknesses of each method is discussed. The focus of the publication then shifts toward 16S rRNA gene NGS methods, which are currently the most cost-effective and widely used NGS methods for research purposes, and are therefore more likely to be successfully implemented into routine clinical diagnostics in the short term. In this respect, the experimental pitfalls and biases created at each step of the 16S rRNA gene NGS workflow are explained, as well as their potential solutions. Finally, a novel diagnostic microbiota profiling platform (`MYcrobiota') is introduced, which was developed by the authors by taking into consideration the pitfalls, biases, and solutions explained in this article. The development of the MYcrobiota, and future NGS methodologies, will help pave the way toward the successful implementation of NGS methodologies into routine clinical diagnostics.},

However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}This study evaluates the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines using simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally-sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera \emph{Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia} and \emph{Klebsiella}.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We evaluated the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic, bacteria such as \emph{Escherichia coli}, but less dominant for clonal species such as \emph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity.

Such an alignment trimming phase is complicated in large-scale phylogenetic analyses that deal with thousands of alignments. Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for largescale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for selecting the most reliable positions in the alignment. These include the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of amino acid similarity and, if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the level of consistency across different alignments. Moreover, trimAl can automatically select the parameters to be used in each specific alignment so that the signal-to-noise ratio is optimized.},

We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1 - V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1 \textendash{} V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterial species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the ``MEGALIGN'' files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: The low cost of 16S rRNA gene sequencing facilitates population-scale molecular epidemiological studies. Existing computational algorithms can parse 16S rRNA gene sequences to high-resolution Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), which represent ecologically coherent entities. Assigning species-level taxonomy to these ASVs is the critical remaining barrier to drawing ecologically/clinically relevant inferences from and comparing data across 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota studies. Results: To overcome this barrier, we developed a broadly applicable method for constructing a phylogeny-based, high-resolution, habitat-specific training set. When used with the naive Bayesian Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, this training set achieved species/supraspecies-level taxonomic assignment to 16S rRNA gene-derived ASVs. The key steps for generating such a training set are 1) constructing an accurate and comprehensive phylogenetic-based, habitat-specific database; 2) compiling multiple 16S rRNA gene sequences to represent the natural sequence variability of each taxon in the database; 3) trimming the training set to match the sequenced regions if necessary; and 4) placing species sharing closely related sequences into a supraspecies taxonomic level to maintain subgenus resolution. As proof of principle, we developed a V1-V3 region training set for the bacterial microbiota of the human aerodigestive tract using our expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD). In addition, we overcame technical limitations to successfully use Illumina sequences for the 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 region, the most informative segment for classifying bacteria native to the human aerodigestive tract. We also generated a full-length eHOMD 16S rRNA gene training set, which we used in conjunction with an independent PacBio Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT)-sequenced sinonasal dataset to validate the representation of species in our training set. The latter also established the effectiveness of a full-length training set for assigning taxonomy of long-read 16S rRNA gene datasets. Conclusion: Here, we present a systematic approach for constructing a phylogeny-based, high-resolution, habitat-specific training set that permits species/supraspecies-level taxonomic assignment to short- and long-read 16S rRNA gene-derived ASVs. This advancement enhances the ecological and/or clinical relevance of 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Molecular approaches targeting the 16S rRNA gene in bacterial community analysis are highlighted, and the advantages and limitations of each technology are focused on. Culture-independent methods to detect microorganisms have been developed in parallel with traditional culture-based methods ever since the classification of bacteria based on 16S rRNA gene sequences was advocated in the 1970s. The development and the prevalence of culture-independent molecular technologies have provided revolutionary progress in microbial studies. The development of these technologies contributes significantly to the research of microorganisms that cannot be detected by traditional methods such as culture-dependent methods.Many molecular methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone library analysis, and next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technologies, have been applied to various microbial studies. Notably, the advent of NGS technologies enabled a large-scale research of the bacterial community. Many recent studies using the NGS technologies have revealed that a larger number of bacteria and taxa than previously thought inhabit various parts of the human body and various places on the earth. The principles and characteristics of each molecular method are different, and each method possesses individual advantages; for example target specificity, comprehensiveness, rapidness, and cost efficiency. Therefore it is important that the methods used in studies are suitable for the objective and materials. Herein, we highlights molecular approaches targeting the 16S rRNA gene in bacterial community analysis, and focuses on the advantages and limitations of each technology.},

  abstract = {Plant-associated microbes play important roles in global ecology and agriculture. The most common method to profile these microbial communities is amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Both the DNA extraction and PCR amplification steps of this process are subject to bias, especially because the latter requires some way to exclude DNA from plant organelles, which would otherwise dominate the sample. We compared several common DNA extraction kits and 16S rRNA gene amplification protocols to determine the relative biases of each and to make recommendations for plant microbial researchers. For DNA extraction, we found that, as expected, kits optimized for soil were the best for soil, though each still included a distinct ``fingerprint'' of its own biases. Plant samples were less clear, with different species having different ``best'' options. For 16S rRNA gene amplification, we found that using peptide nucleic acid clamps provides the least taxonomic distortion, while chloroplast-discriminating primers are easy and inexpensive but present significant bias in the results. Blocking oligos require a more complex protocol and optimization for each species and showed significant taxonomic distortion; therefore, we do not recommend them for off-the-shelf applications. Further methods development will hopefully result in protocols that are even more reliable and less biased than these.  Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s).

  abstract = {SILVA (lat. forest) is a comprehensive web resource, providing services around up to date, high-quality datasets of aligned ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota domains. SILVA dates back to the year 1991 when Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig from the Technical University Munich started the integrated software workbench ARB (lat. tree) to support high-quality phylogenetic inference and taxonomy based on the SSU and LSU rDNA marker genes. At that time, the ARB project maintained both, the sequence reference datasets and the software package for data analysis. In 2005, with the massive increase of DNA sequence data, the maintenance of the software system ARB and the corresponding rRNA databases SILVA was split between Munich and the Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Group in Bremen. ARB has been continuously developed to include new features and improve the usability of the workbench. Thousands of users worldwide appreciate the seamless integration of common analysis tools under a central graphical user interface, in combination with its versatility. The first SILVA release was deployed in February 2007 based on the EMBL-EBI/ENA release 89. Since then, full SILVA releases offering the database content in various flavours are published at least annually, complemented by intermediate web-releases where only the SILVA web dataset is updated. SILVA is the only rDNA database project worldwide where special emphasis is given to the consistent naming of clades of uncultivated (environmental) sequences, where no validly described cultivated representatives are available. Also exclusive for SILVA is the maintenance of both comprehensive aligned 16S/18S rDNA and 23S/28S rDNA sequence datasets. Furthermore, the SILVA alignments and trees were designed to include Eukaryota, another unique feature among rDNA databases. With the termination of the European Ribosomal RNA Database Project in 2007, the SILVA database has become the authoritative rDNA database project for Europe. The application spectrum of ARB and SILVA ranges from biodiversity analysis, medical diagnostics, to biotechnology and quality control for academia and industry.},

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99\% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

We conducted a literature review and used our own data to determine which approaches work best. The two main approaches for analyzing the microbiome, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons and shotgun metagenomics, are illustrated with analyses of libraries designed to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Several methods for taxonomic classification of bacterial sequences are discussed. We present simulations to assess the number of sequences that are required to perform reliable appraisals of bacterial community structure. To the extent that fluctuations in the diversity of gut bacterial populations correlate with health and disease, we emphasize various techniques for the analysis of bacterial communities within samples ({$\alpha$}-diversity) and between samples ({$\beta$}-diversity).

We apply our approach to samples from seven different ecosystems and obtain more than a million SSU rRNA sequences from all domains of life, with an estimated raw error rate of 0.17\%. We observe a large proportion of novel diversity, including several deeply branching phylum-level lineages putatively related to the Asgard Archaea.

In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold. How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from 50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla. Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000 different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics, and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future, high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding pathogens and knowing how to treat them.},

The original version of the Ribosomal RNA Database (rrnDB) cataloged estimates of the number of 16S rRNA-encoding genes; the database now includes the number of genes encoding each of the rRNAs (5S, 16S and 23S), an internally transcribed spacer region, and the number of tRNA genes. The rrnDB has been used largely by microbiologists to predict the relative rate at which microbial populations respond to favorable growth conditions, and to interpret 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial communities. To expand the functionality of the rrnDB (http://ribosome.mmg.msu.edu/rrndb/index.php), the search engine has been redesigned to allow database searches based on 16S rRNA gene copy number, specific organisms or taxonomic subsets of organisms. The revamped database also computes average gene copy numbers for any collection of entries selected. Curation tools now permit rapid updates, resulting in an expansion of the database to include data for 785 bacterial and 69 archaeal strains. The rrnDB continues to serve as the authoritative, curated source that documents the phylogenetic distribution of rRNA and tRNA genes in microbial genomes.},

Counts of 16S sequence variants, often in PCR amplicons, are used to estimate proportions of bacterial and archaeal taxa in microbial communities. Because different organisms contain different 16S gene copy numbers (GCNs), sequence variant counts are biased towards clades with greater GCNs. Several tools have recently been developed for predicting GCNs using phylogenetic methods and based on sequenced genomes, in order to correct for these biases. However, the accuracy of those predictions has not been independently assessed. Here, we systematically evaluate the predictability of 16S GCNs across bacterial and archaeal clades, based on {$\sim$}\,6,800 public sequenced genomes and using several phylogenetic methods. Further, we assess the accuracy of GCNs predicted by three recently published tools (PICRUSt, CopyRighter, and PAPRICA) over a wide range of taxa and for 635 microbial communities from varied environments. We find that regardless of the phylogenetic method tested, 16S GCNs could only be accurately predicted for a limited fraction of taxa, namely taxa with closely to moderately related representatives ({$\lessequivlnt$}15\% divergence in the 16S rRNA gene). Consistent with this observation, we find that all considered tools exhibit low predictive accuracy when evaluated against completely sequenced genomes, in some cases explaining less than 10\% of the variance. Substantial disagreement was also observed between tools (R2{$<$}0.5) for the majority of tested microbial communities. The nearest sequenced taxon index (NSTI) of microbial communities, i.e., the average distance to a sequenced genome, was a strong predictor for the agreement between GCN prediction tools on non-animal-associated samples, but only a moderate predictor for animal-associated samples. We recommend against correcting for 16S GCNs in microbiome surveys by default, unless OTUs are sufficiently closely related to sequenced genomes or unless a need for true OTU proportions warrants the additional noise introduced, so that community profiles remain interpretable and comparable between studies.},

  abstract = {Contaminating sequences in public genome databases is a pervasive issue with potentially far-reaching consequences. This problem has attracted much attention in the recent literature and many different tools are now available to detect contaminants. Although these methods are based on diverse algorithms that can sometimes produce widely different estimates of the contamination level, the majority of genomic studies rely on a single method of detection, which represents a risk of systematic error. In this work, we used two orthogonal methods to assess the level of contamination among National Center for Biotechnological Information Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq) bacterial genomes. First, we applied the most popular solution, CheckM, which is based on gene markers. We then complemented this approach by a genome-wide method, termed Physeter, which now implements a k-folds algorithm to avoid inaccurate detection due to potential contamination of the reference database. We demonstrate that CheckM cannot currently be applied to all available genomes and bacterial groups. While it performed well on the majority of RefSeq genomes, it produced dubious results for 12,326 organisms. Among those, Physeter identified 239 contaminated genomes that had been missed by CheckM. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of using multiple methods of detection while providing an upgrade of our own detection tool, Physeter, which minimizes incorrect contamination estimates in the context of unavoidably contaminated reference databases.},

Here we address this limitation by proposing 24,706 species clusters which encompass all publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomes when using commonly accepted average nucleotide identity (ANI) criteria for circumscribing species. In contrast to previous ANI studies, we selected a single representative genome to serve as the nomenclatural type for circumscribing each species with type strains used where available. We complemented the 8,792 species clusters with validly or effectively published names with 15,914 de novo species clusters in order to assign placeholder names to the growing number of genomes from uncultivated species. This provides the first complete domain to species taxonomic framework which will improve communication of scientific results.},

  abstract = {Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) have been proposed as an alternative to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for analyzing microbial communities. ASVs have grown in popularity, in part because of a desire to reflect a more refined level of taxonomy since they do not cluster sequences based on a distance-based threshold. However, ASVs and the use of overly narrow thresholds to identify OTUs increase the risk of splitting a single genome into separate clusters. To assess this risk, I analyzed the intragenomic variation of 16S rRNA genes from the bacterial genomes represented in an rrn copy number database, which contained 20,427 genomes from 5,972 species. As the number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene increased in a genome, the number of ASVs also increased. There was an average of 0.58 ASVs per copy of the 16S rRNA gene for full-length 16S rRNA genes. It was necessary to use a distance threshold of 5.25\% to cluster full-length ASVs from the same genome into a single OTU with 95\% confidence for genomes with 7 copies of the 16S rRNA, such as Escherichia coli. This research highlights the risk of splitting a single bacterial genome into separate clusters when ASVs are used to analyze 16S rRNA gene sequence data. Although there is also a risk of clustering ASVs from different species into the same OTU when using broad distance thresholds, these risks are of less concern than artificially splitting a genome into separate ASVs and OTUs. IMPORTANCE 16S rRNA gene sequencing has engendered significant interest in studying microbial communities. There has been tension between trying to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to increasingly lower taxonomic levels and the reality that those levels were defined using more sequence and physiological information than is available from a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, the naming of bacterial taxa reflects the biases of those who name them. One motivation for the recent push to adopt ASVs in place of OTUs in microbial community analyses is to allow researchers to perform their analyses at the finest possible level that reflects species-level taxonomy. The current research is significant because it quantifies the risk of artificially splitting bacterial genomes into separate clusters. Far from providing a better representation of bacterial taxonomy and biology, the ASV approach can lead to conflicting inferences about the ecology of different ASVs from the same genome.},

  abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA currently represents the most important target of study in bacterial ecology. Its use for the description of bacterial diversity is, however, limited by the presence of variable copy numbers in bacterial genomes and sequence variation within closely related taxa or within a genome. Here we use the information from sequenced bacterial genomes to explore the variability of 16S rRNA sequences and copy numbers at various taxonomic levels and apply it to estimate bacterial genome and DNA abundances. In total, 7,081 16S rRNA sequences were in silico extracted from 1,690 available bacterial genomes (1\textendash 15 per genome). While there are several phyla containing low 16S rRNA copy numbers, in certain taxa, e.g., the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, the variation is large. Genome sizes are more conserved at all tested taxonomic levels than 16S rRNA copy numbers. Only a minority of bacterial genomes harbors identical 16S rRNA gene copies, and sequence diversity increases with increasing copy numbers. While certain taxa harbor dissimilar 16S rRNA genes, others contain sequences common to multiple species. Sequence identity clusters (often termed operational taxonomic units) thus provide an imperfect representation of bacterial taxa of a certain phylogenetic rank. We have demonstrated that the information on 16S rRNA copy numbers and genome sizes of genome-sequenced bacteria may be used as an estimate for the closest related taxon in an environmental dataset to calculate alternative estimates of the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa in environmental samples. Using an example from forest soil, this procedure would increase the abundance estimates of Acidobacteria and decrease these of Firmicutes. Using the currently available information, alternative estimates of bacterial community composition may be obtained in this way if the variation of 16S rRNA copy numbers among bacteria is considered.},

Thus, full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is needed to reduced biases. A new alternative for fulllength bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is offered by PacBio single molecule, real-time (SMRT) technology. The aim of our study was to validate PacBio P6 sequencing chemistry using three approaches: 1) sequencing the fulllength bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a single bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus to analyze error modes and to optimize the bioinformatics pipeline; 2) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a pool of 50 different bacterial colonies from human stool samples to compare with full-length bacterial 16S rRNA capillary sequence; and 3) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes from 11 vaginal microbiome samples and compare with in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region and with bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene regions sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq. Results: Our optimized bioinformatics pipeline for PacBio sequence analysis was able to achieve an error rate of 0. 007\% on the Staphylococcus aureus full-length 16S rRNA gene. Capillary sequencing of the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from the pool of 50 colonies from stool identified 40 bacterial species of which up to 80\% could be identified by PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of the human vaginal microbiome using the bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region on MiSeq generated 129 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from which 70 species could be identified. For the PacBio, 36,000 sequences from over 58,000 raw reads could be assigned to a barcode, and the in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region generated 154 OTUs grouped into 63 species, of which 62\% were shared with the MiSeq dataset. The PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene datasets generated 261 OTUs, which were grouped into 52 species, of which 54\% were shared with the MiSeq dataset. Alpha diversity index reported a higher diversity in the MiSeq dataset. Conclusion: The PacBio sequencing error rate is now in the same range of the previously widely used Roche 454 sequencing platform and current MiSeq platform. Species-level microbiome analysis revealed some inconsistencies between the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene capillary sequencing and PacBio sequencing.},

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence ({$\geq$}95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at               http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/               .},

For this to succeed, we need an accurate way of linking genotype to phenotype, that identifies new resistance mechanisms as they appear. To assess how close we are to this goal, we characterized antimicrobial resistance determinants in {$>$}4,000 Staphylococcus aureus genomes of isolates associated with bloodstream infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We sought to answer three questions: 1) how well did known resistance mechanisms explain phenotypic resistance in our collection, 2) how many previously identified resistance mechanisms appeared in our collection, and 3) how many of these were detectable using four contrasting genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods. Resistance prediction based on the detection of known resistance determinants was 98.8\% accurate. We identified challenges in correcting for population structure, clustering orthologous genes, and identifying causal mechanisms in rare or common phenotypes, which reduced the recovery of known mechanisms. Limited sensitivity and specificity of these methods made prediction using GWAS-discovered hits alone less accurate than using literature-derived genetic determinants. However, GWAS methods identified novel mutations associated with resistance, including five mutations in rpsJ, which improved tetracycline resistance prediction for 28 isolates, and a T118I substitution in fusA which resulted in better fusidic acid resistance prediction for 5 isolates. Thus, GWAS approaches in conjunction with phenotypic testing data can support the development of comprehensive databases to enable real-time use of WGS for patient management.},

  abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are gen-erally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progres-sively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molec-ular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems-i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy-reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Ar-chaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more king-doms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined.) Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely ther-mophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea). Need for Restructuring Systematics Within the last decade it has become possible to trace evolutionary history back to the (most recent) common ancestor of all life, perhaps 3.5-4 billion years ago (1, 2).

  abstract = {Although Kraken's k-mer-based approach provides a fast taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequence data, its large memory requirements can be limiting for some applications. Kraken 2 improves upon Kraken 1 by reducing memory usage by 85\%, allowing greater amounts of reference genomic data to be used, while maintaining high accuracy and increasing speed fivefold. Kraken 2 also introduces a translated search mode, providing increased sensitivity in viral metagenomics analysis.},
